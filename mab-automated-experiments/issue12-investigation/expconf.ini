# Execution modes - the experiments are run in two phases:
#
# 1. simulations
#    the simulator is run with the specified parameters, and
#    statistics are produced
#
# 2. post-processing
#    some post-processing is done with the statistics produced in
#    the previous stage
#
# Options available for each phase:
#   - none					(simply don't run the phase)
#   - automated				(run the phase in an automated way, according to the parameters)
#   - (a different value)	(specify a relative path of a custom Python script that will be run for the phase)
